DegradingLoad will attempt to load a process serverside async; if it takes too long it will "degrade" to using clientside ajax to retrieve the result without blocking the main page content

Please read the source code to see what I'm trying to achieve. This is a VS2010 solution.

Page degradingload->default.aspx attempts to load a potentially slow resource. If it loads within a set time period, it will be rendered server side. if the async task times out it will instead render the rest of the page and use a clientside ajax call to a webservice to retrieve the results from the slow process and render it clientside.

Pass in a querystring param "timeout=<seconds>" to vary the async timeout: 1 will result in a clientside load, 3 or above in a serverside load.
